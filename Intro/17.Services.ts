### **📌 What is a Service in Angular?**  

A **service** in Angular is a **reusable and centralized logic unit** that provides **data, functionality, or utilities** across multiple components. Services are typically used to **fetch data, handle business logic, share state**, or **interact with external APIs**.

---

## **🔹 Why Use Services?**  

✅ **Code Reusability** → Instead of repeating logic in multiple components, services centralize it.  
✅ **Separation of Concerns** → Keeps components **lightweight** by moving non-UI logic to services.  
✅ **Data Sharing** → Services allow **state management** and **data sharing** between unrelated components.  
✅ **API Interaction** → Services manage **HTTP requests** to communicate with backends.  
✅ **Dependency Injection (DI)** → Services can be **injected** into components and other services, following Angular's DI system.

## **🔹 Common Use Cases of Services**  

1️⃣ **Fetching Data from APIs** (e.g., `HttpClient` in a service to make API calls).  
2️⃣ **Managing Shared Data** (e.g., storing user authentication status).  
3️⃣ **Handling Business Logic** (e.g., calculating discounts in an e-commerce app).  
4️⃣ **Logging and Debugging** (e.g., storing logs for errors or performance tracking).

## **🔹 Summary**  
✔ Services in Angular provide **centralized logic and data management**.  
✔ They **improve code reusability, separation of concerns, and efficiency**.  
✔ Used for **API calls, shared data, business logic, and dependency injection**.  
✔ Services are a key part of Angular’s architecture to build **scalable applications**.
